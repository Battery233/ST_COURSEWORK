# README

This repository can be imported to Eclipse.

TemplateEngineTest.java contains four simple JUnit tests to show how to import the package of our implementation and how to write JUnit tests. 

For black box testing (writing JUnit tests), please use the Jar file under the jar/ directory and write your tests according to the specifications (see Specifications.pdf)

Source code of the implementation is under the src/ directory. Use this to achieve high code coverage.

src/Task1Functional.java is the functional testing part for the code.

src/Task1Coverage.java is the branch coverage testing part for the code.

code-coverage-1.JPG is the code coverage graph for functional testing.

branch-coverage-1.JPG is the branch coverage graph for functional testing.

branch-coverage-2.JPG is the branch coverage graph for coverage testing.
